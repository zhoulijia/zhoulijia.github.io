I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://stat.uchicago.edu/">Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago,</a> advised by Professor <a href="https://home.ttic.edu/~nati/"> Nathan Srebro. </a> 

I am interested in the statistical foundation of machine learning. With the hope of bridging the gap between the classical statistical learning theory with modern practices in data science, I have been trying to understand how over-parameterized models that memorize the training data (such as a deep neural network) can generalize to unseen data through the prism of <i> implicit regularization </i> and <i> uniform convergence.</i> 

Prior to my gradute study, I was an undergraduate student majoring in Applied Mathematics (B.S.) and Staistics (B.S.) at the University of Chicago. I had the pleasure of working with Professor <a href="https://galton.uchicago.edu/~stein/"> Michael Stein </a> on spatio-temporal modeling of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data. 

I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou"> Guangzhou, China. </a> I speak Mandarin and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese"> Cantonese.</a> I also understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaoshan"> Chaoshan </a> dialect.
